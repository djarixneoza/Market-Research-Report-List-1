<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleic Acid Testing</li><li>Antibody Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The COVID-19 diagnostic testing market includes two main types: nucleic acid testing (NAT) and antibody testing. Nucleic acid tests, such as PCR, detect the virus's genetic material, identifying active infections. These tests are highly sensitive and specific. Antibody testing, on the other hand, detects antibodies produced in response to the virus, indicating past infection or immune response. While antibody tests aid in understanding population exposure, they do not confirm active infections, making NAT critical for immediate diagnosis.</p></p>
