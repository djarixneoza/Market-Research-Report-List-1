<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil Free Scroll Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Scroll</li><li>Orbiting Scroll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil-free scroll compressor market consists primarily of two types: fixed scroll and orbiting scroll compressors. Fixed scroll compressors feature a stationary scroll that remains static while the other scroll orbits around it, compressing the gas. Orbiting scroll compressors, on the other hand, have one scroll that orbits around the fixed scroll, providing efficient compression with minimal wear. Both types are designed for applications requiring oil-free operation, offering advantages in terms of reduced maintenance and cleaner output for sensitive environments.</p></p>
