<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-powered Tankless Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas-powered tankless water heater market is divided into two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing units utilize advanced technology to maximize heat exchange, allowing them to extract additional energy from exhaust gases, resulting in higher efficiency and lower emissions. In contrast, non-condensing models operate at lower efficiency, expelling hotter exhaust gases without reclaiming energy. While condensing units often come at a higher upfront cost, they offer long-term energy savings, making them a popular choice for eco-conscious consumers.</p></p>
