<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extrusion PVC</li><li>Injection PVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlorinated Polyvinyl Chloride (CPVC) pipes are categorized primarily into two market types: extrusion CPVC and injection CPVC. Extrusion CPVC is manufactured by forcing molten CPVC material through a die to create continuous lengths of pipe, ideal for plumbing and industrial applications due to its uniformity. Injection CPVC, on the other hand, involves melting the material and injecting it into molds to produce fittings and other components, offering precision and complex shapes. Both types leverage CPVC's superior chemical resistance and high-temperature tolerance.</p></p>
