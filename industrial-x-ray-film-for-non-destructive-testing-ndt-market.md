<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial X-ray Film for Non-destructive Testing (NDT) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Screen Type Films</li><li>Screen Type Films</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial X-ray films used for non-destructive testing (NDT) can be categorized into two main types: non-screen type films and screen type films. Non-screen type films are directly exposed to X-ray radiation, providing high-resolution images suitable for detecting small defects. In contrast, screen type films are used in conjunction with fluorescent screens, which amplify the X-ray signal and reduce exposure time, thus producing images with improved sensitivity and a broader dynamic range. Both types cater to various industrial inspection needs.</p></p>
